iOS internet browser app suitable for older people - picker allows main websites to be selected and shown on display.

Websites shown on picker are as follows: 
- 'home' page with instructions on the app's use

Built using XCode's Storyboard feature to implement UIWebView and Picker.

Developed in February 2012 while on app development course taught by Aral Balkan.

This code was developed prior to the release of XCode 4.4 and iOS 6 but still works without errors or warnings.
